# Unhandled JSON Decoding Exception in Dart API Call

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart applications: incorrectly handling JSON responses from API calls.

The `bug.dart` file showcases code that attempts to fetch JSON data but fails to properly handle potential errors during JSON decoding.  This can lead to application crashes or unexpected behavior.

The `bugSolution.dart` file provides a corrected version, demonstrating best practices for error handling and safe JSON decoding.
